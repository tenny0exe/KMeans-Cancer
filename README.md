# KMeans-Cancer
# KMeans_Cancer.ipynb

Objective: This notebook aims to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze a cancer dataset. The goal is likely to see if K-Means can identify distinct groups within the data, potentially corresponding to different types or stages of cancer. Clustering can be a valuable exploratory tool in medical datasets.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and loading.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: For basic plotting.
pyspark: This indicates the notebook is intended to use Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework. Spark is very useful for handling large datasets. The notebook imports various modules from pyspark.sql (for DataFrames) and pyspark.sql.functions (for SQL-like operations on DataFrames).
sklearn.cluster.KMeans: The K-Means implementation from scikit-learn (even though the notebook leans towards PySpark for data handling).
sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: To split data into training and testing sets.
sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: For scaling data.
sklearn.metrics: To evaluate the clustering and classification performance (confusion matrix, accuracy, f1-score).
Key Steps:
Data Loading:
The notebook defines a path variable, likely pointing to a CSV file named "data.csv". It then uses pd.read_csv() (from pandas) to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
If Spark is used, there might be steps to convert the pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame.
Data Exploration:
The code prints the column names of the DataFrame to understand the features available.
df.dtypes is used to display the data types of each column.
df.describe() provides descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns.
The code checks for missing values using df.isnull().sum().
Data Preprocessing:
Features are selected for clustering (stored in the features variable). The notebook drops columns like 'id' and 'Unnamed: 32' as they are unlikely to be relevant for clustering. The 'diagnosis' column is also dropped here, as K-Means is unsupervised and doesn't use labels during clustering.
Scaling: StandardScaler is used to standardize the features (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation). This is important for K-Means because it's a distance-based algorithm, and scaling prevents features with larger ranges from dominating the clustering process.
K-Means Clustering:
The notebook creates a KMeans model with n_clusters=2. This suggests the goal is to see if the data naturally separates into two groups. In the context of cancer, this could be trying to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors, or perhaps different subtypes of cancer.
The fit() method trains the K-Means model on the scaled feature data.
Cluster assignments are obtained using kmeans.labels_.
The cluster centers are accessed using kmeans.cluster_centers_.
Visualization:
The notebook creates a 2D plot to visualize the clusters. Since K-Means works with multiple dimensions, it selects two features ('radius_mean' and 'texture_mean') for easy plotting. Data points are colored according to their cluster assignment. The cluster centers are also plotted.
A 3D plot is also generated to visualize the clusters in a three-dimensional space ('radius_mean', 'texture_mean', and 'perimeter_mean').
Classification (Supervised Learning):
This part of the notebook shifts to a supervised learning task. It appears to be building a classification model to predict the 'diagnosis' (whether a tumor is malignant or benign). Note that this is separate from the clustering done earlier.
The 'diagnosis' column is mapped to numerical values (M=1, B=0).
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Scaling: StandardScaler is applied again, separately to the training and testing data. It's crucial to fit the scaler only on the training data to avoid data leakage.
A Logistic Regression model (LogisticRegression()) is created and trained on the scaled training data.
Predictions are made on both the training and testing sets.
The model's performance is evaluated using:
Confusion matrix
Accuracy score
F1-score (for both classes)
Important Considerations:
Spark Usage: The presence of pyspark imports suggests that this notebook might be designed to handle larger datasets by leveraging Spark's distributed computing capabilities. However, some parts of the code (like using pd.read_csv and scikit-learn's KMeans and LogisticRegression) are pandas/scikit-learn, which operate on a single machine. A fully Spark-based implementation would use Spark's MLlib library.
Clustering vs. Classification: It's important to distinguish between the K-Means clustering (unsupervised) and the Logistic Regression classification (supervised) parts of the notebook. They address different questions. Clustering explores inherent groupings in the data, while classification builds a model to predict a specific outcome ('diagnosis').
Medical Data: When working with medical data, it's crucial to be cautious about interpretations and to consult with domain experts. Machine learning models provide insights but should not be the sole basis for medical decisions.
